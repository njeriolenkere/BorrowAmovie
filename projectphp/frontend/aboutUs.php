                        <p> Movies are very important parts of our lives. They bring out stories of our dreams to vision. Giving us the ultimate quest of imagination as you watch them. Facts bring close the information we never thought we knew. Yet fantasy and science fiction open worlds that was never there before. Movie is our life.It helps us bring you close to reality yet able to let you escape out of this chaotic world taking you to a land of magic, imagination and wonder.</p>
